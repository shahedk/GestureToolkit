# Gesture Toolkit

A toolkit to simplify the large screen (eg. 25"-80") multi-touch application development and testing. It supports WPF and Silverlight framework.

### Features

* A predefined set of common gestures. (i.e. sample gestures)
* A domain-specific language to define new gestures including multi-step, multi-user, multi-touch scenarios
* A device independent architecture that allows the application to run on different devices (i.e. Microsoft Surface, SMART Tables, Windows 7 Touch enabled devices)
* A test framework that allows to write unit tests to validate touch interactions and gesture definitions
* A record/playback tool for testing & debugging applications as well as simulating multi-user scenarios
* A visual effects framework to provide consistent visual feedback for touch interactions & gestures
